# Test Output Directory

This directory contains persistent test output files generated during test runs. Unlike temporary directories, these files are preserved after tests complete to allow manual inspection and debugging.

## Directory Structure

```
test_output/
├── test_<timestamp>/          # Individual test run directories
│   ├── *.npz                  # AlphaGenome prediction data (NumPy archives)
│   ├── *.json                 # Metadata and configuration files
│   ├── *.h5ad                 # AnnData files for variant scoring
│   └── *_files.json          # File lists for variant predictions
└── prediction_result_*.npz    # Model test files
└── variant_result_*.json      # Model test files
└── scoring_result_*.json      # Model test files
```

## File Types

- **`.npz` files**: Compressed NumPy archives containing genomic track data (values, metadata, intervals)
- **`.json` files**: Human-readable metadata, configuration, and file lists
- **`.h5ad` files**: AnnData format for variant scoring results
- **`*_files.json`**: File lists linking reference/alternate predictions

## Cleanup

The directory is automatically cleared at the start of each test session but preserved after completion. To manually clean up:

```bash
rm -rf test_output/
```

## Inspection

You can examine the files to understand:
- What data AlphaGenome predictions generate
- File formats and structures used
- Metadata included with predictions
- File organization patterns

## Generated By

These files are created by the test suite in `tests/test_server.py` and represent realistic AlphaGenome MCP server outputs for debugging and validation purposes.
